# Perfect_Numbers

Write a program that prints the perfect numbers between 1 and n; where n is the
input from users.

Hint: A number is a perfect number if is equal to the sum of its proper
divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.
Example: All perfect numbers between 1 and 1000 are: 6, 28, and 496;
6 is divisible by 1, 2, and 3; 1+2+3=6 perfect number!
28 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14; 1+2+4+7+14=28 perfect number!

Sample Input/Output:
Enter n: 10000
All perfect numbers in the range 1 and 10000 are:
6, 28, 496, 8128
